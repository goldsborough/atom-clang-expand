/**
 * Stores an ordered multimap of expansions.

 * Our requirements:
 * 1. We want to store ranges of expansion in a two-dimensional space (the
 * editor).
 * 2. Given a location (point) in the text, we want to quickly find the
 * corresponding range, or quickly determine that there is no such range.
 * 3. Given a new range (expansion), we want to quickly insert it into the data
 * structure.
 *
 * Normally, the answer here would be a two-dimensional data structure such as a
 * [UB-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UB-tree). However, this would
 * obviously be a mess to implement. Also, if we inspect the problem further, we
 * can make a crucial observation: while there may be many expansions throughout
 * a long source file, there will be only *few expansion within each row*,
 * probably at most 1-2. As such, all we really need is an ordered list where we
 * can logarithmically lookup a row. As of now and probably for ever, I have
 * implemented this as a simple sorted array, where each element in the array is
 * again an array (termed a bucket), storing all entries whose ranges start at
 * that particular row. Lookup works via lower-bound search (finding the first
 * row that's not less), insertion via upper-bound search (finding the first row
 * that's not greater). If this becomes a performance bottleneck (it won't),
 * consider a balanced RB/AVL tree (don't).
 *
 * Expansions are first ordered by the row of their starting point and then
 * thrown into a bag in case there are multiple expansions on one row. The set
 * provides functions to efficiently search, remove and insert new expansions in
 * logarithmic time.
